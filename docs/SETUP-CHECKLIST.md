## üî• CRITICAL: The marketplace.json File

**Location:** `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`

**Why critical:**
- Claude Code specifically looks for `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- Without this file, your repo is NOT a valid marketplace
- Must be in this exact location
- Must be valid JSON

**The file I created for you points to your skills:**
```json
{
  "commands": [
    "./skills/requirements-clarifier/SKILL.md",
    "./skills/implementation-planner/SKILL.md",
    "./skills/breakthrough-generator/SKILL.md"
  ]
}
```

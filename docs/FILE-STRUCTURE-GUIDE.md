## 🚀 Step-by-Step Upload Instructions

### Step 1: Organize Your Files Locally

```bash
# Navigate to where you have your plugin files
cd /path/to/your/thoughtful-dev-plugin-files

# Create the required structure
mkdir -p .claude-plugin
mkdir -p skills/requirements-clarifier
mkdir -p skills/implementation-planner
mkdir -p skills/breakthrough-generator/references
mkdir -p templates/project-claude
```

### Step 2: Copy Files to Correct Locations

```bash
# Copy the marketplace.json I created
cp /path/to/downloaded/marketplace.json .claude-plugin/

# Copy your existing skill files
cp /path/to/your/requirements-clarifier/SKILL.md skills/requirements-clarifier/
cp /path/to/your/implementation-planner/SKILL.md skills/implementation-planner/
cp /path/to/your/breakthrough-generator/SKILL.md skills/breakthrough-generator/
cp /path/to/your/breakthrough-generator/references/* skills/breakthrough-generator/references/

# Copy template files
cp /path/to/your/personal-CLAUDE.md templates/
cp /path/to/your/project-claude/* templates/project-claude/

# Copy documentation files I created
cp /path/to/downloaded/README.md ./
cp /path/to/downloaded/INSTALL.md ./
```

### Step 3: Create Missing Files

```bash
# Create CONTRIBUTING.md (copy content from above)
nano CONTRIBUTING.md

# Create CHANGELOG.md (copy content from above)
nano CHANGELOG.md

# Create LICENSE (copy content from above)
nano LICENSE

# Create .gitignore (copy content from above)
nano .gitignore
```

### Step 4: Initialize Git and Push

```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init
git branch -M main

# Add remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/Neno73/thoughtful-dev.git

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial marketplace setup with Thoughtful Dev plugin v1.0.0"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# Create release tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### Step 5: Verify on GitHub

Visit: https://github.com/Neno73/thoughtful-dev

You should see:
- ✅ All files in correct locations
- ✅ `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` visible
- ✅ Skills directory with all SKILL.md files
- ✅ Templates directory with all templates
- ✅ README.md displaying properly
- ✅ v1.0.0 release tag created

## 🎯 Critical File: marketplace.json

The **most important** file is `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. This file MUST be in the root of your repository inside a `.claude-plugin/` directory.

**Contents:**
```json
{
  "name": "thoughtful-dev-marketplace",
  "owner": {
    "name": "Neno73",
    "email": "[email protected]"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "description": "Transform Claude Code into a thoughtful development partner...",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "thoughtful-dev",
      "source": "./",
      "description": "Complete thoughtful development workflow...",
      "commands": [
        "./skills/requirements-clarifier/SKILL.md",
        "./skills/implementation-planner/SKILL.md",
        "./skills/breakthrough-generator/SKILL.md"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Why it matters:**
- Claude Code looks for this EXACT file at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- Without it, your repository is NOT a valid marketplace
- The `commands` array tells Claude where to find your skills
- The `source` field (`./`) means skills are in the same repo

---

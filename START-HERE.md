## 🎯 The One Critical Thing

**The marketplace.json file in `.claude-plugin/` directory is THE most important file.**

Without it, your repository is not a valid Claude Code marketplace.

It's already created for you with:
- Your GitHub username (Neno73)
- Correct paths to your skills
- Proper plugin configuration

**Location:** `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`

---

## ⚠️ What You Still Need To Do

This package contains the marketplace structure and documentation, but you need to add:

1. **Your skill files** (from your existing plugin):
   - `skills/requirements-clarifier/SKILL.md`
   - `skills/implementation-planner/SKILL.md`
   - `skills/breakthrough-generator/SKILL.md` + references/

2. **Your template files** (from your existing plugin):
   - `templates/personal-CLAUDE.md`
   - `templates/project-claude/` (7 files)

Once you copy these files, you're ready to push to GitHub!
